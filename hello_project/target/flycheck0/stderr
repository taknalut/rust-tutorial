error: current package believes it's in a workspace when it's not:
current:   /Users/tak/Documents/Coding/Rust/hello_project/Cargo.toml
workspace: /Users/tak/Documents/Coding/Rust/Cargo.toml

this may be fixable by adding `hello_project` to the `workspace.members` array of the manifest located at: /Users/tak/Documents/Coding/Rust/Cargo.toml
Alternatively, to keep it out of the workspace, add the package to the `workspace.exclude` array, or add an empty `[workspace]` table to the package's manifest.
